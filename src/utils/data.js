    content: `I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with a strong foundation in building responsive, user-friendly web applications. With a keen eye for design and performance, I specialize in crafting seamless digital experiences using modern technologies like React.js, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. My goal is to bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality, ensuring every project I work on is both visually appealing and highly performant.
      
      \nMy journey in web development started with a simple curiosityâ€”how does the web work? Fast forward to today, I have built dynamic applications, collaborated with teams, and honed my skills in frontend and backend development. I love tackling challenges, optimizing user experiences, and bringing creative ideas to life through code. Let's build something amazing together!`,
